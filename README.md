# handwritten-digits-recognition-master
This project is a machine learning-based system for recognizing handwritten digits (0â€“9) using image classification techniques. Leveraging a trained neural network model, the system takes grayscale digit images (like those from the MNIST dataset) and predicts the corresponding numerical value with high accuracy.
